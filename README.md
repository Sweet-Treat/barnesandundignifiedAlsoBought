# Project Name

> The objective of the Front End Capstone is to build a fullstack application emulating a single product page of a real company. Our project will mimic the product page of a book in the Barnes and Noble site, broken out into four separate components: (1) product details, (2) add to cart, (3) similar books, and (4) reviews. I am building the similar books section, which consists of an image carousel and a brief recap of similar books (title, author, rating, image of the book cover).
